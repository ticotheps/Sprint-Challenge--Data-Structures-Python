Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

The runtime complexity for 'append()' is O(1) (linear time) because (while n = the value of the single 'item' that we're adding to the buffer) as n increases, we will only ever perform the same number of operations to add that 'item' each time the append() function is called.

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

The space complexity for 'append()' is also O(1) (linear space)because (while n = the value of the single 'item' that we're adding to the buffer) as n increases, we will only ever have the same amount of space/memory that was originally allocated to the ring buffer when the buffer was instantiated with the 'capacity' parameter.

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
